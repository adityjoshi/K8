# Docker: Structure and Process Control Analogy

## 1. Introduction

Docker is a containerization platform that enables the packaging of applications along with their dependencies into isolated environments called containers. These containers are lightweight, reproducible, and consistent across various environments.

---

## 2. Docker Architecture

Docker follows a client-server architecture, consisting of the following key components:

### a. Docker Client

The user-facing CLI (`docker`) that issues commands. It communicates with the Docker daemon via REST API over Unix sockets or a network interface.

### b. Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)

The background process that manages container lifecycles, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for requests from the client and handles container orchestration.

### c. Docker Images

Read-only templates that define the filesystem and configuration for a container. They are built using `Dockerfile` instructions and are versioned in layers.

### d. Docker Containers

Runtime instances of images. Containers are isolated using Linux kernel primitives such as namespaces and control groups (cgroups).

### e. Docker Registry

A storage and distribution system for Docker images. Public registries (like Docker Hub) or private registries can be used to push and pull images.

### f. Volumes

Volumes provide persistent data storage for containers and are managed outside the Union filesystem.

## 3. Container vs Process: Analogy with PCB

In traditional operating systems, each process is tracked using a **Process Control Block (PCB)**. This includes metadata such as PID, state, CPU context, memory layout, open file descriptors, and accounting information.

In Docker, each container can be conceptually compared to a process with a similar control structure maintained by the Docker Engine.

| PCB Field (OS Process)         | Equivalent in Docker Container                    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Process ID (PID)               | Container ID (Hash)                               |
| Process State                  | Container State (`created`, `running`, `paused`)  |
| Program Counter, Registers     | Entrypoint and command                            |
| Memory Information             | cgroups-enforced memory limits                    |
| Open Files, IO                 | Mounted volumes, network interfaces               |
| Accounting Info                | Stats from `docker stats`, lifecycle timestamps   |
| Parent/Child Relationships     | Container dependencies (if orchestrated)          |

Docker persists container metadata in directories under:

/var/lib/docker/containers//

---

## 4. Docker Lifecycle (Process Flow)

The Docker container lifecycle mirrors the typical OS process lifecycle:

- `docker create`: Defines configuration and allocates metadata (analogous to `fork`)
- `docker start`: Starts execution of the container process
- `docker stop`: Gracefully halts the container (`SIGTERM`)
- `docker kill`: Forcefully terminates the container (`SIGKILL`)
- `docker pause/unpause`: Freezes and resumes the container using cgroups freezer
- `docker rm`: Deletes the container and associated metadata

### Lifecycle Stages:

Created → Running → (Paused) → Exited → Removed

## 5. Underlying Linux Kernel Features

Docker containers leverage the following Linux kernel primitives for isolation and control:

| Feature         | Functionality                                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Namespaces      | Isolate container resources (PID, network, user, mount) |
| cgroups         | Enforce CPU, memory, and IO limits                      |
| UnionFS         | Layered filesystem support for images and containers    |
| Seccomp/AppArmor| System call filtering and security policies             |
| RunC/containerd | Low-level container runtime execution                   |
